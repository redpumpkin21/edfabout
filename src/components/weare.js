            <div>
                <p>We began in 1967, as a scrappy group of scientists and a lawyer on 
                    Long Island, New York, fighting to save osprey from the toxic pesticide DDT. 
                    Using scientific evidence, our founders got DDT banned nationwide.
                </p>
                <p>Today, weâ€™re one of the world's leading environmental organizations. 
                    In the U.S., Fortune magazine called our board one of the country's most influential 
                    nonprofit boards.
                </p>
                <p>And science still guides everything we do.</p>
